Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer
A web application that uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT NLP model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Built with Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and Streamlit.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pretrained Transformer model for sentiment analysis and deploy it as an interactive web application.
Users can enter a movie review and receive a predicted sentiment along with the model’s estimated probabilities for positive and negative sentiment.
  Features
• Positive and negative movie review classification
• Fine-tuned DistilBERT model
• Text preprocessing using a Hugging Face tokenizer
• Prediction probabilities and confidence display
• Interactive Streamlit user interface
• Model hosting through the Hugging Face Hub
  Technologies Used
• Python — application programming
• PyTorch — deep learning framework
• Hugging Face Transformers — pretrained and fine-tuned NLP models
• Hugging Face Hub — model hosting
• Streamlit — web application interface
• IMDB Dataset — movie review sentiment dataset
  How It Works
1. A user enters a movie review.
2. The tokenizer converts the text into model inputs.
3. The fine-tuned DistilBERT model processes the inputs.
4. The application predicts positive or negative sentiment.
5. The result and predicted class probabilities are displayed.

The trained model and tokenizer are hosted separately on Hugging Face rather than stored in the GitHub repository.
  Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sentiment-streamlit.git
cd sentiment-streamlit
2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
Activate it on Windows PowerShell:
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
3. Install dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure the model
In app.py, set the model path to your public Hugging Face model repository:
MODEL_PATH = "YOUR_USERNAME/sentiment-distilbert"
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your Hugging Face username.
5. Run the application
python -m streamlit run app.py
Open the local URL displayed in your terminal, usually http://localhost:8501.
  Example Predictions
Positive review
The movie was fantastic, and the actors delivered excellent performances.
Negative review
The movie was boring, poorly written, and disappointing.
Predictions may vary depending on the review and the model’s learned patterns.
  Model Evaluation
The model was fine-tuned for binary sentiment classification using the IMDB movie review dataset.
Add your actual test accuracy and evaluation results here after training. Do not report an accuracy value unless it comes from your evaluation.
  Limitations
• The model was trained for movie review sentiment classification and may not generalize well to other types of text.
• Sarcasm, mixed opinions, and ambiguous reviews may lead to incorrect predictions.
• Predicted probabilities are estimates, not guarantees of correctness.
  Future Improvements
• Add a review history feature.
• Evaluate the model on additional datasets.
• Improve the interface and error handling.
• Add batch sentiment analysis for multiple reviews.
